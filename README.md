# Helios Solar Tracking Module

## The Aim
I want to build a solar-tracking solar panel system that can alter its position based on the position of the Sun in the sky. This starts with the design and build of an API system that takes in the user specified latitude and longitude (either from geolocation or user input) and returning the elevation and azimuth of the Sun in the sky at that specific time.

# To-Do List
- [x] Get latitude and longitude from user IP
- [ ] Add functionality for passing custom lat/long coordinates
- [ ] Get the solar position on a repeating cycle (need to also add custom cycling to allow for time movement)
- [ ] Design architecture for position tracking
- [ ] Choose between robotic arm and 2DOF platform - something like this (active ball joint)[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hhDdfiRCQS4] would be interesting to use, but complex to build (I NEED A 3D PRINTER FFS)
