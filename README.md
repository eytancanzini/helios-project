# Helios Solar Tracking Module

## The Aim
I want to build a solar-tracking solar panel system that can alter its position based on the position of the Sun in the sky. This starts with the design and build of an API system that takes in the user specified latitude and longitude (either from geolocation or user input) and returning the elevation and azimuth of the Sun in the sky at that specific time.
